# Biosim-project
An attempt to write a program designing neural-networked "players" who can respond to stimuli, in which successful players reproduce iteratively with occasional mutations to find neural-networked solutions to problems. Heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&amp;list=LL&amp;index=12 David Miller's project and video
